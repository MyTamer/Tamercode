/**
 * Extension of the {@link BatchPreparedStatementSetter} interface,
 * adding a batch exhaustion check.
 *
 * <p>This interface allows you to signal the end of a batch rather than
 * having to determine the exact batch size upfront. Batch size is still
 * being honored but it is now the maximum size of the batch.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #isBatchExhausted} method is called after each call to
 * {@link #setValues} to determine whether there were some values added,
 * or if the batch was determined to be complete and no additional values
 * were provided during the last call to <code>setValues</code>.
 *
 * <p>Consider extending the
 * {@link org.springframework.jdbc.core.support.AbstractInterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter}
 * base class instead of implementing this interface directly, using a single
 * <code>setValuesIfAvailable</code> callback method that checks for available
 * values and sets them, returning whether values have actually been provided.
